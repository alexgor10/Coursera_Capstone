## SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

### Data Collection with Web Scraping
In this lab, you will be performing web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon\_9\_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches

### Data Collection with API
In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

### Data Wrangling
In this lab, we will perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

### EDA-sql
Using this Python notebook you will:
Understand the Spacex DataSet, Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database, Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions.

### EDA-data-visualization
In this lab, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

### Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium
In the previous exploratory data analysis labs, you have visualized the SpaceX launch dataset using matplotlib and seaborn and discovered some preliminary correlations between the launch site and success rates. In this lab, you will be performing more interactive visual analytics using Folium.

### Plotly_Dashboard
In this lab, we will build a dashboard using pandas dash package and plot charts using Plotly.

### Machine Learning Prediction
In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
